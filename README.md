# 🧠 SQL Case Study – Data Mart Sales Analysis 2020

## 📌 Project Title  
**Data Mart Sales Performance Analysis – 2020**

---

## 📄 Description

This case study is based on a sales dataset from a Data Mart company of the year 2020. The dataset contains approximately **17,000–18,000 rows**.

According to the company, **major supply chain changes** were implemented in **June 2020**, including a shift to **sustainable packaging methods** at every step — from farm to customer.  
This analysis aims to understand the **impact of those changes on sales performance** across different platforms, demographics, and regions.

## 🧱 Database Schema

### Original Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS weekly_sales (
    week_date DATE,
    region VARCHAR(100),
    platform VARCHAR(100),
    segment VARCHAR(100),
    customer_type VARCHAR(100),
    transactions INT,
    sales INT
);
```

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps
I created a new table called **clean_weekly_sales** with the following transformations:

1.Week Number: Assign week numbers based on week_date (1st–7th Jan → Week 1, etc.).

2.Month Number: Extract month number from week_date.

3.Calendar Year: Extract year (2018, 2019, or 2020).

4.Age Band: Created from the number in segment:

    1 → Young Adults
    
    2 → Middle Aged
    
    3 or 4 → Retirees

5.Demographic: Derived from the first character of segment:

    C → Couples
    
    F → Families

6.Null Handling: Replaced NULL or empty values with "Unknown" in relevant columns.

7.Average Transaction: sales / transactions, rounded to 2 decimals as avg_transaction.

## ❓ Key Analysis Questions
1.Which week numbers are missing from the dataset?

2.Total transactions per year?

3.Monthly total sales per region?

4.Transaction count per platform?

5.Retail vs Shopify: monthly sales percentages?

6.Yearly sales breakdown by demographic?

7.Top age_band and demographic contributors to Retail sales?
